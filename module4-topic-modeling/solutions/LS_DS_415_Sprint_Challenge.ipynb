    "\n",
    "After a week of Natural Language Processing, you've learned some cool new stuff: how to process text, how turn text into vectors, and how to model topics from documents. Apply your newly acquired skills to one of the most famous NLP datasets out there: [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge). As part of the job selection process, some of my friends have been asked to create analysis of this dataset, so I want to empower you to have a head start.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The real dataset is massive (almost 8 gigs uncompressed). I've sampled the data for you to something more managable for the Sprint Challenge. You can analyze the full dataset as a stretch goal or after the sprint challenge. As you work on the challenge, I suggest adding notes about your findings and things you want to analyze in the future.\n",

    "## Challenge Objectives\n",
    "*Successfully complete these all these objectives to earn a 2. There are more details on each objective further down in the notebook.*\n",
    "* <a href=\"#p1\">Part 1</a>: Write a function to tokenize the yelp reviews\n",
    "* <a href=\"#p2\">Part 2</a>: Create a vector representation of those tokens\n",
    "* <a href=\"#p3\">Part 3</a>: Use your tokens in a classification model on yelp rating\n",
    "* <a href=\"#p4\">Part 4</a>: Estimate & Interpret a topic model of the Yelp reviews"

       "On the second floor of the Arts Central building sits a little gem of a coffee shop. Formerly \"the Palette\", the new sleek look of deVille has only further encouraged former Palette frequenters to come back. Comfy couches and chairs are arranged in cozy groupings, offering a level of privacy and intimacy for a quiet conversation. Brick walls and tall open windows that allow sunshine to stream in add to the ambiance. \\nNot to mention, they make the BEST espresso drinks. Lattes and cappuccinos are always topped with decorative designs, which is a nice touch, and they are so creamy and smooth. The desserts in the display case look fantastic every time I'm in there. Lately I've tried a triple chocolate cookie with my coffee which was amazingly rich, buttery and so very cholately. \\nPrices aren't that bad, either. The price for a flavoured latte here is nearly the same as a tall Starbucks latte, and deVille makes MUCH better espresso. \\nYou can get your coffee beverage to go if you're in a rush, but I recommend taking a few moments to enjoy your coffee in this little oasis downtown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0.0001\n",
       "In spite of naming a drink after me this is still the premiere drinking experience in cleveland and probably the world at large don't @ me.\\n\\nNo one cares more about making drinks or an experience around it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        0.0001\n",
       "Very long review, but if you are planning on having your wedding here you should read this before you set the date .....\\nSo many issues with this place! Unreal! \\nThey are suppose to make this whole thing easier on the bride and groom and instead it was a nightmare. Issue after issue with them. Not happy with the service we were given. \\nFirst we had problems with The staff. They  had problems getting our paperwork in order. We had to send it several times, and spoke to several different coordinators that obviously didn't communicate. They called to change our time 2 weeks after we set the date and time. I was printing out the invitations when she called, so wasn't too big of a nightmare, but still set me back. They changed our time because the minister wasn't available at that time. This is something that should be taken care ahead of time before they book a wedding at that time.  I was told I had one coordinator then was given to another one. So confusion was an issue. \\nThen we had set up a phone appointment to go over final plans 4 weeks before the wedding. She called two hours after our set appointment to say sorry we had a lot of walk-in and I got caught up. I set out time in my busy schedule to talk to her and she was very not convincing in apologies. We had an appointment that should have come first instead of those people that walked in.  So I rescheduled the appointment for the following week. Again 3 hours later after our set appointment she called again saying she was sorry that she got caught up. I was ready to cancel the whole thing, and find someone else. Had I not had family flying in from around the country I would have. \\nThe icing on the cake was the limo! He was 15 minutes late picking us up so we arrived at the grove basically when the wedding was suppose to start. As I got out of the limo my dress rubbed on the door frame and was covered in black oil! i was so angry, but what can you do? They should have a clean limo picking up brides in white dresses one would think. The coordinator got club soda, but it was oil. My dress was ruined down the side. Her response was sorry it will come out when you clean it, and the photographer will touch up every picture so you wont see it. That was besides the point. My $1000 wedding dress was ruined before the ceremony even started. \\nThe ceremony went well thus the 2 stars instead of one. The Minister was awesome, and the photographer was great as well. Even though there was much confusion. The ceremony started almost 20 minutes late because the ending of the wedding before us was still getting pictures. I was left in the brides room standing there waiting for the photographer to take pictures before the ceremony.\\nThe thing that sent me over board was the limo driver. When we arrived back at out reception area he told us he was on overtime and that we owed him $60 bucks for being an hour late arriving back at our destination. This was not our fault! He was 15 minutes late for picking us up, and the coordinators and photography was slow on getting us going. So it wasn't our fault. My husband was irate as he said he mobbed us for the money. We just got married and were ready to enjoy the night at our reception, and instead of taking it up with the grove (because they are hired out not part of the groves staff) he mobbed us for the money demanding it really. I got my purse and gave him the difference of what we had originally tipped him and went on our way. This was a nightmare! So disappointed with the service given by the grove and the limo company the grove hires. The minister and photographer were amazing, but this place gave us issue after issue making our wedding not so pleasant. \\nI recently met a new friend through my husbands work who also got married at the grove. We both had stories to tell, and went on about it for bout an hour. I have urged her to write a review as well about the horrible service she was given to spread the word.    0.0001\n",
       "Didn't really plan on getting a loan but as a college student, sometimes you have to do what you have to do. I heard of them a couple years back but never really gave much attention since I was in no need of a loan. But the time came and TFC has made the process a whole lot less stressful. It almost seemed so fast considering the fact that I just started building my credit. I had a couple fees at the mechanic that I needed to get paid and was in need of some emergency cash. I was approved the same day and was not charged any pre payment fees.

The price is reasonable and the Food comes out quick.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0.0001\n",
       "Wow! This place was great. The service was amazing, fast, and even though there was a long line behind us, the lady at the register explained things to us and was very kind. The drinks were super fresh! I am so happy we finally have a great boba place on the southwest! We will definitely be returning. We got the almond milk tea, rose milk tea, and Hokkaido milk tea. I can say all three were delicious!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0.0001\n",
       "One of my favourite bars on College st. The food prices increased from last year, when they had a $6 menu very similar to Queen St. Warehouse. To make matters worse, the portions shrunk by 50%. \\n\\nOrdered buttermilk chicken wings, mac and cheese, and some nacho dish. We were served 2 chicken wings, 4 spoon fulls of mac and cheese, and literally 3 nacho chips on a dish. All of this came out to $40 after tax and tip?!\\n\\nNext time, I will stick to drinks and the dance floor downstairs. Although the quality of food was good and dishes were tasty, the portion size was dissapointing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0.0001\n",
       "Terrible service. 3 other tables that were seated after us and ordered after us were served first. Our waitress told us we could not order soup even though it was listed as part of the entree. Other tables in the restaurant were eating soup already and were served soup later. When our food finally did come, it came in 3 waves over 15 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0.0001\n",
       "I've been here a couple times to grab a quick taco, and they're amazing. The tacos are inexpensive, tasty, and big! Sure is a lot better than taco bell. At $2.50 each, the beef taco costs less than a hotdog from a street vendor, and it's much more satisfying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0.0001\n",
       "I went out for dinner with my family on Sunday. I've been to Applebee's a couple times. I have to say I am never going back. The service was lacking and the food was terrible. As soon as I went home I was sick. The food poisoning I got from there lasted 3 days. It was terrible. I really hope nobody else got sick.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0.0001\n",

       "What's not to love about furry, feathered or finned creatures? I have cats and dogs (they live with their mom at the moment) so I haven't been able to do nearly as much treat-buying and toy-purchasing as I would like. Instead, I live my life through the squirrels I see foraging in the wooded area behind my apartment. Petsmart is great for the bird seed that squirrels love to \"steal\". It's hard to steal when I'm tossing the stuff off my deck so these cute little ones can gather it.\\n\\nWhoa. Back to the review.

       "I got a Bulldog, which is a kielbasa with saurkraut and spicy brown mustard. Unfortunately, the kielbasa was relatively tasteless. They have a lot of different bottles of beer, but I couldn't find many local beers. The beers on tap were not local beers, but were nationally available.

       "Fun place to dine al fresco.   Nice view of the Bellagio  and they had nice heaters outside for the chilly days and nights.  \\n\\nFood was delicious. Scallop dish was well cooked, and the chicken and brie crepe has good flavor and extremely filling.\\n\\nThe pate was also quite good, but the mustard that came with it oxidized rather quickly, so by the end of our meal it tasted a little different.  Ask for extra bread with it cause you'll need it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0.0001\n",
       "While I had high hopes for this place with the online imagery and upscale pricing, I am disappointed to say the food and service on this particular occasion was sub-par.  I have lived in Madison for 20 years, eaten at nearly every Italian restaurant over the years (except this one), and thought I'd give it a try with my wife.  The coffee we ordered was cold, and it took 20 minutes to get our waitress' attention to get it refilled (Note:  There were literally three other tables occupied on this particular Thursday evening at Bellini, so it wasn't slow service due to a dinner rush).  I want to note, however, that our second cup was much better.  Anyway, onto the food.  The garlic bread florentine was quite good...but that is where our satisfaction stopped.  My wife got the fettuccini giovanni, and the white wine cream sauce was like eating processed cheese sauce over noodles-heavy, salty and overbearing.  The sausage was cold in the centers and had an off-taste to it as well.  Furthermore, the presentation with the prosciutto was as if the cook simply threw a couple of slices randomly into the dish along with a handful of hot-dog cut sausage circles-nothing even close to the well-presented pictures posted on their website.  My dish, the pollo parmigiana, was unimpressive, with the fettuccini noodles being tough and in a terribly watery marinara sauce base that simply flowed off the noodle through your fork, leaving plain noodles per bite.  The chicken breasts were flavorful and well-prepared, though.\\n\\nNow, this was our first visit, and I hope we simply caught them on a bad day, so I am giving them 2 stars rather than 1 in case this is the reason for such a disappointing meal not worth the $18/plate it cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0.0001\n",

       "I visited Sugar Fowl with my parents recently.  I was raised in Scottsdale and haven't been there since the 1990s -- I was excited to return there.\\n\\nBut I wasn't prepared for some nastiness.  The bussers, instead of putting dirty dishes on a hand tray and carrying them back to the kitchen, will roll out a big nasty wheeled cart into the dining area which is stacked with dirty dishes and also has a garbage bin attached to it.  So, you'll be sitting there trying to enjoy a meal and out comes the nasty smelling cart which is parked next to your table while the busser cleans a table next to you.  The cart smells bad, as you can imagine.  I've never seen that done before, even in a dive restaurant!\\n\\nSo, I decided to phone Sugar Fowl and speak to the manager.  I expected him to be surprised at my news, and possibly apologize, but instead he was immedately defensive about the practice, saying they've always done it that way and are not going to change it.  I was speaking in a polite manner, but he was obviously having a bad day and used a rude tone of voice.  He said they do it because they have a high turnover of customers.  Really?  A McDonalds has five times more business than they do, and they don't wheel out nasty carts!  Sugar Fowl also needs to train staff to clean the restrooms and pick up garbage from the dining area floors!\\n\\nI read other negative reviews here on Yelp before visiting Sugar Fowl, but wanted to go there for nostalgic reasons anyway.  I should have believed the negative reviews.  The place has obviously gone downhill over the years.  I told the manager I would be posting a negative review here, and he said \"go ahead.\"  I recorded video of the busser performing the nasty cleaning, and posted it on YouTube for all to see.  People may not always believe words written here on Yelp, but they'll believe what they see with their eyes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0.0001\n",
       "Terrible service and small servings that are over priced. It was our first time and will no doubt be our last. The menu doesn't describe the dishes in detail like that something comes with mushrooms so if you don't like that there is no chance to have it taken off. When asked by the waiter to have them removed it took 3 times to get him to understand I wanted my meal simply without them. He tried offering me a different dish and even argued he told us it had mushrooms when in fact he didn't. Just wasn't the restaurant environment we are use to and won't return. Unfriendly staff!

       "We ate dinner tonight and had an exceptional waiter, Jeff.  We were using a Local Dines certificate that had been generously extended by local dines due to family health issues.  When the waiter went to the manager, I believe is name was mark, and explained the situation, he would not make the time to come and talk to us, instead my husband had to go back out to the car in 106 degree heat, as he would not accept the \"green\" certificate I had on my phone.  He made no effort to even speak to us, yet visited several of the tables around us.  This, we felt, was extremely unprofessional and a huge turnoff.  If a restaurant is going to participate in Local Dines, Groupon, etc, the customers should receive the same quality of service and respect as others.\\n\\nThe arrogance displayed tonight by the manager has completely unnecessary and unprofessional.  We are extremely disappointed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0.0001\n",
       "Rose's Cleaners and Alterations is the ONLY trustworthy cleaner in Las Vegas. There are probably 50 cleaners that are closer to my house, but I make the drive to Rose's because they get the job done correctly every single time. They've gotten stains out that other dry cleaners said were irremovable. They've mended clothing that other tailors said were impossible to mend. Everything is done quickly, and the customer service can't be beat. Yoonha has remembered me by name since my second visit. She also offers to alert you via call or text if needed. They let you know well in advance when they are leaving town, so you can pick up your cleaning on time.\\n\\nFor my dry cleaning, quality is more important than convenience. There's nothing worse than the feeling of picking up a suit and finding it to be irrevocably damaged by a careless cleaner. If you want a cleaner and tailor you know with 100% confidence will get the job done correctly and promptly every single time, Rose's Cleaners and Alterations is the only way to go.\\n\\nPAY CASH if you can! This is a small, family-owned business, and they will start giving you a little bit of a cash discount if you consistently pay with cash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0.0001\n",

If you're sensitive to dairy, you'll have an upset stomach later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0.0001\n",
       "We stopped here for breakfast this morning and were pleasantly surprised.  We enjoy eating at local restaurants and were happy with our choice.  They open at 8:00 am we arrived about 9:15 am and were the only people there.  We both had the Suicide Jim's Feast which included 3 eggs, two pancakes home fries, two slices of toast and either 3 strips of bacon or two sausage patties.  I was able to finish mine as I'm a big eater, but my wife brought her pancakes home for lunch.  The prices are great and the even have a traditional breakfast with 2 eggs, 2 bacon strips, 1 sausage patty, home fries and toast for only $4 ($3 without the meat) so their prices are very good.  They also have daily specials and we are looking forward to going for dinner soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0.0001\n",
       "If it weren't for the fact that this is convenient and close to my work, I neverrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr stop here. I try to stop at the Starbucks by my house before work  but my desire to beat traffic won out this morning so I decided to try a stop here since it had been awhile. NOPE this location still sucks.\\n\\nIt's turning into a homeless shelter.  At 6:20 am there was one homeless guy wandering around out front begging, another slumped in an outside table sleeping, and a third (this one was a tweaker) sitting inside Starbucks twitching and winking at people walking into the restaurant. \\n\\nLook, I get that Starbucks implemented a No Judgment Rainbows and Unicorns Everyone Welcome policy, but this is ridiculous.  At this location, corporate customers are your customer base, period.  Bending over backwards to allow tweaker skuzzers and beggars into your establishment just turns away your core customer base. Who wants to spend $4 on a cuppa joe only to have Twitchy come and ask for spare change with a creepy glint in his eye as he gnashes his gums together hungrily for his next fix?   I, for one, will recommit to never stopping in here again because the ambiance is awkward and creepy now instead of what a Starbucks should feel like- buzzing, bustling, energetic, caffeinated, warm, inviting. Take my feedback for what you will, because I know the location's never closing down because it is 1. Starbucks and 2. Near so many companies. Those two facts alone will ensure the continued viability of this halfway-er, I mean, coffee house.\\n\\nAlso the baristas are usually in a bad mood.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0.0001\n",
       "I am the unfortunate tenant from Barrett Eastman properties that was included in this company. Their tenant portal is more down than not and I was told to mail rent out to Mesa during the holiday mail. I tried to reach Barrett Eastman as I had a money order after my account had some fraud and didn't have funds in the account that was linked. Barrett was easy, just drop it off, no problem. 2 miles down the road. When asked if I can make an automated payment, I was told no. I don't feel comfortable to mail a money order out that large, especially during holiday mail. \\nAnyways, I feel tempted to reach out to the house owner, so he knows what his tenants are being lumped in on. Also, I have asked them to take off my auto pay, if I can pay hrough the portal, but I have not received a confirmation whether they did or not, I shouldn't have to haunt for answers. Bad customer service. You are not a customer, just a portfolio here. At least that is my experience so far.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0.0001\n",
       "I find it ridiculous in the amount of time it takes to get your child! You have to get there about 20min early (just to be able to be in some what front of the line) & of course still wait till the time they are out to not only wait another 15-20min to just get finally receive your kids!! & for some reason (I find completely use less) while your sitting in your car waiting a teacher/staff member comes walking between the lanes w/ a tablet to ask and mark down your children's name, as if we were ordering something and waiting in line to get to the window and receive your order lol.\\nWHY DO THEY MARK IT DOWN? DON'T KNOW? it's honestly not like it makes it any faster! sure makes it seem like they are organized in doing so, but I asked my child one day & she said they just say \"okay (child's name) your parent is here get ready\" as a type of warning Im sure? but then she added on & said \"but sometimes I can't hear who they say because it's really loud & I get in trouble if Im not ready because I wasn't listening\".\\nSo my point is they need to find a new way to organize this situation. I can't fathom the amount of waiting it takes for parents with more than one child!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           0.0001\n",
       "My first time here was last week during a pool tournament and I can say this place is pretty comfortable to play pool there. There are quite a few 7' tables, 6-8 9' tables, I wasn't sure about the total tables but they were space pretty good. \\n\\nWhen you walk in, there are tables to your left and right but majority of the tables are on your left, straight ahead is the bar with computer gaming machines. Downfall is there's no food, you have to go next door to get some. \\n\\nOverall it's a good place to play, wish it was non-smoking. I would go again if I was in that area of town.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0.0001\n",
       "This was my first time here. It's been a while since I've pampered myself, so I decided to get a full set and lashes. I give me nail tech 5 stars but my lash tech and over environment a 1. \\n\\nMy nail technician was great, friendly and very skilled. She paid close attention to details and proactively worked with me on my design. I'm naturally very oily, so acrylic and polish tend to start lifting after a few days. I informed her of this and she added extra primer, to ensure longevity. It's been a week and I see no signs of lifting or peeling. \\n\\nMy lashes looked amazing on day one. However, they started falling on that day as well . It's been only 1 week and they are 80% gone. I paid $160 for my lashes and expect them to last more the. 1weeks. I've had my lashes done for 4 years and they have never fallen out this fast. I followed all the after care procedures and even used a sealant to protect them. \\n\\nI narrow it down to a few issues.\\n1. My tech was not in a good mode and kept complaining about wanting to go home. She constantly made comments about her frustration with my lashes. \\n2. She was rushing on my left eye, which is the side I saw a drastic lost.\\n\\nEnvironment- the salon is beautiful and modern. However, their employees lack professionalism and class. The side conversations were highly inappropriate and offensive at times. The nail techs weren't as bad as the lash folks. \\n\\nThe lash folks used an uncomfortable amount of profanity and talking about they sexual conquests. I'm not a prude by any means but I do believe in professionalism, in front of customers. And I really don't care about your \"slow blow\" issues and how you gave some guy oral for 90 minutes. \\n\\nThe lash folks openly complained about their schedule and even got into a fight with the reception about their schedule. \\n\\nOverall, their lash staff lacks maturity and needs lots of coaching but management didn't seem to care. I definitely will not be returning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       0.0001\n",
       "Ordered an iPad screen repair replacement through the app. They showed up within a couple hours and took about 20 minutes to finish it. Extremely satisfied!! Like a windshield repair service they come to you. What a great idea!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0.0001\n",
       "Who would have thought a lap of luxury spa could be found outside downtown? Tucked away the Crowfoot Crossing complex in the NW, once you step through the doors you're instantly transformed into a Thai inspired escape. As always, I arrive early to my massage appointments to take advantage of the amenities the spa has to offer. With specially made tea and delicious crisps/crackers (the banana nut flavor is my fave!) in hand, I make my way to the Bali Sanctuary (where there are heated stone loungers and tranquil music) lay back, relax and enjoy my snack. I've had both individual and couple massages here and they are phenomenal, I leave feeling rejuvenated every time. \\n\\nThe staff are super accommodating and every part of this place is pristine.\\n\\nIf you're ever in the mood to treat yourself, head to Spa Ritual!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0.0001\n",
       "This is not, in fact, the NY style pizza you are looking for BUT it is a solid tasty lunch spot. They've got decent lunch specials and it's usually not too busy so they're fast. Wouldn't recommend this place for dinner though, it looks pricey and if the pizza tastes the same at dinner, likely not worth it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0.0001\n",

       "Made a return visit after buying gift cards at Costco ($100 for $80). Went on a Wednesday night for dinner. If you don't want loud music definitely don't sit on the bar side. We were so happy we didn't sit on bar side. Lots of TVs playing sports (soccer and baseball) which is great. Server was very nice. Food was very good. The Champignons Paris is a must. The NY strip loin medium rare was decadent. The Grillades plate is a good choice to have a bit of a few things. (4 types of meat on it including ribs). Service time was reasonable.  Will definitely go back again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0.0001\n",
       "Picasso's is cool, my girlfriend used to live in the area so we frequently visit Charlotte. Picasso's is a great place with lots of TV's, seating and games. The drinks are inexpensive and the food looked good. My only complaint is that they didn't have the UFC fight on there.

       "Overall - 3.0/5.0\\n\\nThis is owned by two sister-in-laws who have just opened their first brick and mortar quick serve restaurant after running pop-ups for the past couple years. Their concept is to bring the essence of street food from Mumbai while using primarily local ingredients and only 100% halal meat.\\n\\nWe tried a few dishes from their menu:\\n\\nChicken Frankie - This was just alright in terms of flavour but the overall texture of the filling was quite mushy and the layering of roti which held the whole thing together was a little too thick and doughy for me. \\n\\nBeef Kheema Pav - Worst dish out of the three we had ordered. Menu did a good job of describing the dish but the end product was fairly disappointing. Ground beef was cold as if it was left sitting out for a while in a large tray prepared ahead of time. The bun was soaked in the grease and butter which made it inedible. \\n\\nSalli Chicken Bowl - Best main dish out of the three we had ordered. I liked the combination of textures with the potato sticks and the curried chicken.\\n\\nAcross all dishes, I thought the flavouring was quite mild which is likely more acceptable to the general public. Perhaps I am used to bigger and bolder flavours from South Indian dishes. \\n\\nIn terms of side dishes, we ordered the following:\\n\\nDaal Chawal Rice - Not as 'fragrant' as I had expected.\\n\\nMixed Salad - Fresh combination of ingredients with a nice crunchy texture but it could definitely use more acidity. \\n\\nGunpowder Fries - Well seasoned and very crispy. These were enjoyable to eat and complimented well with the milder curries.\\n\\nWe also tried the Kesar Crunch soft serve ice cream dessert which was decent. It was not too sweet and had a great combination of saffron, crushed biscuits and pistachio.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0.0001\n",
       "I LOOOOOVE this place!  I've been going for about 2 months now and EVERY class has been different!  The instructors are motivating and encouraging and are always helping to correct form when needed.  They are knowledgeable as well.  \\n\\nI also like the fact that every class is a different workout - we use different equipment and every class pushes me to get out of my comfort zone (which is awesome)!  The music is great too!  I love it so much I committed to 6 months unlimited :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0.0001\n",

       "Loved this studio. I was on vacation last week in Scottsdale and found BYNS on Yelp. I almost did not go because when I called I found out they had carpet floors in the yoga room. I am so glad that I went anyway. The carpets were clean and a hospital grade anti-bacterial type. The studio was large with plenty of room for people to spread out. I took classes from Sandy, Bridget and Christine. I did the out of town special which was a great deal. It included 5 lessons in 7 days plus mat and towel. Perfect for travelers. The instruction was great. I usually do 60-90 minutes of Vinyasa style hot yoga at home 2-3 times per week and dread the 90 minute original series (Bikram), but doing it 4 days in a row on vacation, I could really see my practice improve. When I got home, I couldn't wait to get back to a 90 minute practice. I even did a 30 day challenge last year and loved it but realize that when I am rushing to and from classes between work and kids is not helpful to mentally prepare me for class. Now I will try to give myself more time to get to class and prepare for it. I will definitely go back to BYNS the next time I am in Scottsdale and highly recommend it for anyone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0.0001\n",
       "Not a huge location, but they have a fairly good selection of guns and other related paraphernalia. Staff is friendly but not pushy.

       "I've seen a lot of reviews here... Complaining about the service... I think most of you need to chill a bit... Could the service be a tad better... Yeah it could... But the food totally makes up for it... English is a slight problem for some of the Workers... But it's a Chinese restaurant... Duh... Please don't listen to these negative reviews... You Only will be missing a great dining experience.... Huge menu even better preparation... My only complaint is I ate too much.... I usually bring food home... But the flavors were unique and wonderful.... Can't wait to go back.... It will be a while since I live in Los Angeles.... This place would do great there...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0.0001\n",
       "We placed a takeout order from this restaurant while staying at this resort over the 4th of July weekend.\\n\\nWhile we were paying for our food, we asked the hostess if there were paper plates in the bag with our eating utensils and she told us they were out. Great - wish we knew that before we chose to eat there. So, we walked across the property to another restaurant where they were at least able to hook us up with food baskets lined with wax paper.\\n\\nUpon returning to our room, we discovered that we had no utensils to eat with and they shorted us two orders of mashed potatoes. The good news is they reacted fairly quickly, sending someone directly to our room in less than ten minutes.\\n\\nThe food, however, was far from good. I specifically ordered the jalapeno coleslaw because it sounded interesting (and I like spice), but it had no flavor resembling jalapenos whatsoever. It wasn't bad tasting, but what you actually get is not how they are marketing it on the menu.\\n\\nThe pulled pork didn't have a lot of flavor and came with no sauce at all. The meat was tender, but was very dry - not moist like good BBQ should be. Mashed potatoes were okay. The 3-cheese mac 'n cheese was not that great. When my kids order macaroni and cheese at a restaurant, they usually end up with Kraft - which is fine for kids. When I order 3-cheese mac 'n cheese, I expect something that is going to taste quite a bit better than something out of a box, but this stuff was not good at all. It didn't taste that great and the consistency was strange.\\n\\nWhen I can smoke pork on my Weber grill at home that is better than a resort restaurant, and they are marketing themselves as a \"smokehouse\" having great BBQ - that isn't a good sign. While I am usually willing to give most places a second chance, Hole in the Wall will not be one of them.\\n\\nIf you are even remotely thinking about eating at this place while you are staying there, I would highly recommend you choose another restaurant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0.0001\n",
       "Dear Nadege,\\n\\nConverted photo gallery-turned-patisserie, oh how you tempt me with your glorious displays, minimalist decor, friendly staff, and above all, scintillating taste experience! \\n\\nI'm always in search of the perfect croissant and yours comes very close. I love its buttery crispy exterior and decadent interior. My personal fave is the chocolate-almond. It's the perfect marriage of dark chocolate and sweet almond paste enclosed in buttery pastry. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! And your lattes - espresso heaven!\\n\\nI'll certainly be returning, so keep my seat warm!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0.0001\n",

       "Very good show. My wife and I both enjoyed this show. The show is full of amazing stunts, acrobatics, fire and special effects. I wont go much into the plot because I don't want to spoil it for anyone but, it is a bit of a love story mixed with lots of martial arts. This one has a little more action then some of the other Cirque shows so if you are trying to convince your spouse to see a Cirque show this might be a good option. (unless you are both okay with topless then I would go with zumanity). The price is a little high at over a $100 but you can find a better deal if you don't buy from the hotel. I would highly recommend this show..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0.0001\n",
       "I had my first Hakka cuisine experience at Chilli Chicken House when I was at Mississauga recently. I was really amazed by the food. It was a spicier version of chinese food and tasted a little like south asian cuisine. Loved their chicken pakora!  The shrimp pakora was wonderful too and the pakora had generous amount of shrimps! We ordered the Spicy Shrimp, Manchurian Chicken with the Thai fried rice. I love my food really spicy so I loved the Spicy Shrimp. \\nTo me the Manchurian Chicken sauce seemed the blander version of the Spicy Shrimp sauce so it was my least favorite of all the food ordered that day.\\nKids seemed happy with their Pad Thai and Hakka Rice Noodles.\\n\\nThe owner and workers were very friendly, helpful and checked on our group frequently. Oh, it is a cash only service.\\nDecor was just ok but it was neat and clean and living in southern California i have seen worse.\\n\\nDefinitely 5 stars for the food and service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        0.0001\n",
       "I SO wanted to give Evo four stars. Their food was certainly good enough for that however last night, their service was a mess. Our server, Joy, was wonderful and did everything within her power to keep things from going sideways but when another round of wine couldn't find it's way to the table (and never did) because they didn't have enough glasses, I knew we were in trouble. They had a number of larger parties there which according to Joy, contributed to the problem, but seriously - if you're running a relative hot spot in Scottsdale on a Saturday night, you should be able to handle that. \\n\\nBottom line - food was great but management has a LOT of work to do. The Evo I saw last night was not ready for prime time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0.0001\n",
